                            Event bubbling is a method of event propagation in the HTML DOM API when an event is in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle to that event. It is a process that starts with the element that triggered the event and then bubbles up to the containing elements in the hierarchy.

                            <p>JavaScript Promises are a modern approach to handle asynchronous operations. Although we can handle small small asynchronous operations using Callback Functions, but not large operations. Promises can handle long and nested asynchronous operations easily.</p>
                            <p>A Promise is said to be resolved or settled when it is fulfilled or rejected. Once settled (resolved or rejected), a Promise cannot be changed. That means a Promise is immutable after settled.</p>
                            <p>A Promise is always in one of these states, pending, fulfilled and rejected. For chaining in Promise, we can use then or catch method.</p>

                                <li><b>rejected</b>: the operation was failed</li>

                            <p>Async keyword is used before function keyword. Async function will always return a promise. Even if the return value of async function is not a promise, it will still be wrapped in a promise.</p>
                            <p>Thus, function will be called synchronously, but the return value will come asynchronously as it is a promise.</p>

                            <p>await keyword or operator is used inside async function to wait for promise. await will wait for promise to full filled or reject and return the output.</p><br />
