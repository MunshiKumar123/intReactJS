                        <p className='ans'>JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is simply a syntax extension of JavaScript. It allows us to directly write HTML in React (within JavaScript code).</p>

                        <p className='ans'>Real DOM is what you see on your browser screen and virtual DOM is copy of it. The main difference is that when you make changes in any part of real DOM, It re-renders the whole DOM at once and that affects efficiency of your server loading cause it has to reload the whole page as browser can only read JS, Html/CSS.</p>

                        <p className='ans'>A functional component is just a plain JavaScript pure function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element(JSX). A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function that returns a React element.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p className='ques'>Diff. Between controlled and uncontrolled components.</p>
                        <p className='ans'>In React, a controlled component is a component that is controlled by React state, while an uncontrolled component is a component that maintains its own internal state.</p>

                        <p className='ans'><mark>Prop drilling</mark><br />
                            Prop drilling occurs when a parent component passes data down to its children and then those children pass the same data down to their own children. This process can continue indefinitely. At the end, it's a long chain of component dependencies that can be difficult to manage and maintain.<br />

                            <mark>prop</mark><br />
                            They are read-only components. Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.

                        <p className='ans'>The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components. Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM.<br />useEffect accepts two arguments. The second argument is optional.<br />

                        <p className='ans'>are tools optimize performance in React Component. <br />useCallback is a hook that will return a memoized version of the callback function that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed.</p>

                        <p className='ans'>The useMemo is a hook used in the functional component of react that returns a memoized value.<br />
                            The useMemo Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update. This can improve performance.</p>

                            The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders. It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated. It can be used to access a DOM element directly.

                            It can be used together with the useState Hook to share state between deeply nested components more easily than with useState alone.</p>

                            The useReducer is a hook I use sometimes to manage the state of the application.

                            The useReducer Hook returns the current stateand a dispatchmethod.

                        <p className='ans'>React are a crucial aspect of error handling in React applications. They are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.</p>

                        <p className='ans'>a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. HOCs are commonly used in React for various purposes, such as authentication, routing, data fetching, and code reuse. Libraries like React Redux and React Router use HOCs extensively to provide functionality to components. However, with the introduction of React Hooks, some of the patterns and use cases of HOCs can be achieved more elegantly using hooks like useContext and useEffect.</p>

                        <p className='ans'>In functional components, you can achieve the same optimization as Pure Components using the React.memo higher-order component. It works similarly by memoizing the component and preventing re-renders when the props haven't changed.</p>

                            The Redux store has a method called dispatch. The only way to update the state is to call store.dispatch() and pass in an action object.

                            <mark>Payload (optional):</mark> Any data that needs to be sent along with the action. The payload contains information relevant to the action, such as the data to be added, updated, or deleted.</p>

                            A reducer is a function that receives the current state and an action object, decides how to update the state if necessary, and returns the new state</p>

                            Global app state is kept in a single store. The Redux store is the main, central bucket which stores all the states of an application. Reducer functions are used to update the state in response to actions</p>
